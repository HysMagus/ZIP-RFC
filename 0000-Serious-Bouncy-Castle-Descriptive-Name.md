# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This is a one paragraph summary of what this proposal is doing. This proposal is a very serious summarization on getting a Bouncy Castle for the ZCoin offices with the thought process being to insure that the ZCoin team has a healthy work environment where they can accomplish greater amounts of productivity atop their already frankly ridicoulously high output rate. 
# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This section explains why we need to do this proposal. The ZCoin Team needs a bouncy castle because Reuben, Anwar Aram, Tadhg, Peter, Sandra, Poramain and the rest of the Zcoin team are working in a high stress environment where they are slowly going crazy with the amount of innovation they are outputting and amazing community they are sheparding. They need a place to unwind and relax as well as to insure that the development and research team does not burn out before Lelantus is released. 

# Community-level explanation
[community-level-explanation]: #community-level-explanation

This is the section where we explain it as if we were explaining it to a noob. If this was software and not a bouncy castle, there would be sections on the functionality, featuers, need for the community etc.
However since this is a bouncy castle it can be expained as such.

The Bouncy Castle is a core part of the ZCoin Project as it provides a place for the founding and core team to bounce around and relieve stress through the ancient science of having fun.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For core, node, wallet and infrastructure proposals: Does this feature exist in other projects and what experience have their community had?
- For community, ecosystem and moderation proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other projects.

Note that while precedent set by other projects is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that Grin sometimes intentionally diverges from common project features.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project and ecosystem as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project and language in your proposal. Also consider how it fits into the road-map of the project and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.

# References
[references]: #references

Include any references such as links to other documents or reference implementations.
