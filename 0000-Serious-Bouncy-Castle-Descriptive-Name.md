# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This is a one paragraph summary of what this proposal is doing. This proposal is a very serious summarization on getting a Bouncy Castle for the ZCoin offices with the thought process being to insure that the ZCoin team has a healthy work environment where they can accomplish greater amounts of productivity atop their already frankly ridicoulously high output rate. 
# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This section explains why we need to do this proposal. The Zcoin Team needs a bouncy castle because Reuben, Anwar Aram, Tadhg, Peter, Sandra, Poramain and the rest of the Zcoin team are working in a high stress environment where they are slowly going crazy with the amount of innovation they are outputting and amazing community they are sheparding. They need a place to unwind and relax as well as to insure that the development and research team does not burn out before Lelantus is released. 

# Community-level explanation
[community-level-explanation]: #community-level-explanation

This is the section where we explain it as if we were explaining it to a noob. If this was software and not a bouncy castle, there would be sections on the functionality, featuers, need for the community etc.
However since this is a bouncy castle it can be expained as such.

The Bouncy Castle is a core part of the Zcoin Project as it provides a place for the founding and core team to bounce around and relieve stress through the ancient science of having fun.  
# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Here's where we explain the technical aspect of the proposal, if this was software you would explain how it would interact with other aspects of the software and functionality. Since this is a bouncy house, it would be in the center of the Zcoin offices, it would be plugged into the same outlets as the computers, and printers.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

A bouncy castle indoors inside of the Zcoin offices may prove to be logistically difficult, and there is the off chance that the Zcoin team does not like bouncy castles. 

Bouncy castles may be hard to keep inflated long term and may have bad impacts on the electricity bills

A bouncy castle in the Zcoin offices would only benefit the core team, contributors and community members outside of the Zcoin core team would not be able to enjoy the bouncy castle. 

If the community does get access, it could become a point of centralization, and the network could shift and split to revolve around the bouncy castle, with both miners and masternodes fighting on who gets the greater percentage of time in the castle.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- This is the section why this is is better then all other options, the simple fact of the matter is... Bouncy castles are empirically better than trampolines
- Here we provide an alternative option, A lesser option would be to have an in-house masseuse but that would be obviously illogical and expensive 
- What is the impact of not doing this? In this case, if we don't do this, the Zcoin team may get too stressed out with all their crazy innovation stuff and may defect to the DOGE team.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Enjoyable fun-rooms and solutions have existed in Silicon Valley for a while
- [Google has slides](https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-office-slides-2012-5)
- [A Law Firm has also implemented bouncy castles](http://newworker.co/mag/when-a-law-firm-wants-a-bouncy-castle-in-their-office-drawing-the-line-between-fun-and-practical-office-design/)
This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other projects.

Note that while precedent set by other projects is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- Who will buy the bouncy castle?
- Are indoor bouncy castles legal?
- Will [Rasikh, the proposer](https://twitter.com/rasikhmorani) be allowed to use the bouncy castle as he made the RFC 
- Does the Zcoin team want a bouncy castle?
- Will picking one brand of bouncy castle introduce centralization to that one brand?
- Will Aram be able to somehow Jerry Rig the Lelantus protocol to cover bouncy castle users?
- Will the bouncy house salesman accept Zcoin?
- Will Sandra be able to add the bouncy house to the Zcoin marketing materials?
- Will the bouncy house be black and green?
- Will competitors such as PIVX want to make a competing bouncy house for their team that is more bouncy than Zcoins?
- Is Particl interested in sharing a bouncy house to save on costs?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is where you cover the sections of how this could evolve. Reuben and Poramin could love the bouncy house so much, they could buy specific ones for different members of the team with different levels of bounce.

Zcoin could kill Bitcoin, as Bitcoin obviously does not have a bounce house

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
